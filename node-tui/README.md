# Strangelet
Terminal-based text editor written in haxe whose code base is largely inspired by micro with minor infulence from Vim/Neovim.
This project's primary goals are to create a terminal-based text editor that is cross-platform and extensible with an efficient workflow.

## Specific code editor features intended include:

- [ ] Code Folding
- [ ] Goto Definition
- [ ] Goto File
- [ ] Integrated File Explorer
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Single Instance (via flag)
- [ ] Command Integration (similar to vim's `:<command>`)
- [ ] Vertical and Horizontal Splits
- [ ] Cross-editor Plugin Support
- [ ] Built-in LSP Feature Support
    - [ ] Syntax Highlighting
    - [ ] Auto-completion
- [ ] Customizable Keybinds
- [ ] Customizable Theme
and more

This editor is built as a learning process just as much as it is built out of desire for a more feature rich version of micro.
