# HaxeTestProjects
Repo for small haxe projects to learn various different project types in the language.
Projects are broken apart into subdirectories named after the library utilized and/or the intendend purpose.

Each project is intended to be a minimal viable project such that an example of how to move forward can be provided.

## Projects
#### Async
Utilizes the async library to showcase asynchronous calls, sleeps, and etc within haxe.

#### Benchmark
Just a simple automation of executing the same code from multiple different compile targets.

The intent is to show how compile times would differ.

#### Heaps
Simple 3D graphics utilizing the heaps library.

Heaps comes with a large amount of tools and can build with hashlink offering a large amount of targets.

#### Heaps-CubeField
Basic game inspired by the old flash game of the same name but this one uses heaps.

#### HelloWorld
Small Hello world in haxe to show a minimal project example.

#### HL-Tui (Uncomplete)
Showcase for terminal user interface inside haxe and hashlink

#### HxBit
Simple networking example using hxbit.  compiles using hashlink which gives it alot of compile targets.

#### HxRaylib
3D graphics using raylib.  Raylib is only available in C++ even though there are headers and definitions written in haxe.

This means it can only compile to C++ despite being in haxe.

Large amounts of resources online for examples that are easily convertible to haxe.

#### HxWebSockets
Networking example written using the hxwebsockets library.

Comes with a built in room handling system simplifing networking.

Compiles using hashlink offering a large number of targets.

#### Mphx
Networking example using mphx library.

Is able to compile using hashlink which expands its range of compile targets

#### Node
Minimal nodejs example for haxe.

#### Node-Heaps
Minimal example using nodejs and heaps together.

#### Node-Oimo (Uncomplete)
Graphics example using haxe, nodejs, and Oimo (js).

#### Node-P2P
Networking example using haxe, nodejs, and hyperswarm.

#### Node-P2P-Pkg
Networking example using haxe, nodejs, and hyperswarm.

Packaged into a library to be utilized by other projects

#### Nothing
Simple example for a friend

#### Tui
Small tui example for haxe using console.hx

#### Udprotean
Networking example using udprotean library.

#### Web-Coconut
Web example using the coconut library to bundle haxe with html/js.
